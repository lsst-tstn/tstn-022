   While analyzing data taken during campaigns in late 2019 and early 2020 with the LATISS instrument in the Auxiliary Telescope, we noticed that the sky position angle on the headers gave inconsistent results. At the same time we noticed that some data taken with longer exposure times and subsequent data taken on the same field showed signs of rotation. After analysis of the data we discover that the issue was due to the pointing component having the wrong direction for the rotator. This tech-note documents our findings.
